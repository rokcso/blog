# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rokcso.

### I'm a maker of things, rider of motorcycle, and like to cook.

Live in [Hangzhou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%AD%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82), an ancient, beautiful and comfortable city in China.

I's a product manager, know a bit of programming, love creating, have some projects that are [in progress](/now) and some that have been [put on hold](/projects).

I write [some texts](/blog), about life, technology, and curiosity, among other things.
