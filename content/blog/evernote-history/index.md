Legendary investor, programmer, and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham once wrote that one of the best ways to come up with ideas for your next startup is to ask what product you wish someone else would make for you.

传奇投资者、程序员、Y Combinator 联合创始人 Paul Graham 曾经写道，为下一次创业提出想法的最佳方法之一就是询问你希望其他人为你生产什么产品。

For Stepan Pachikov, founder of Evernote, that product was a way to help him remember things.

对于 Evernote 的创始人 Stepan Pachikov 来说，那个产品是一种帮助他记住事情的方式。

Although Pachikov first began working on what ultimately became Evernote back in 2002, his fascination with human memory stems from his experiences growing up in the former Soviet Union. To Pachikov, Evernote wasn’t just another app or a way to capitalize on Silicon Valley’s burgeoning obsession with personal productivity. It was an extension of the human mind itself that would let users remember everything.

尽管 Pachikov 早在 2002 年就开始研究最终成为 Evernote 的东西，但他对人类记忆的迷恋源于他在前苏联的成长经历。对他来说，Evernote 不仅仅是一个应用程序，也不是为了利用硅谷对个人生产力的日益增长的痴迷。它是一种人类思维的延伸，可以让用户记住一切。

Evernote has come a long way since Pachikov began working on the app seventeen years ago. Evernote was and remains one of the best examples of what a freemium product can be. Despite this, Evernote has been plagued by a series of managerial missteps and failed product launches, and the company’s future is far from certain.

Evernote 自 Pachikov 17 年前开始开发这款应用以来，已经取得了长足的进步。它曾经，并且仍然是免费增值产品中的佼佼者。尽管如此，Evernote 一直受到一系列管理失误和失败产品推出的困扰，公司的未来远未确定。

Here are some of the things I’ll be exploring in this article:

在这篇文章里，我会研究以下几点：

- Why timing was so crucial to Evernote’s success, and how co-founder and former CEO Phil Libin’s vision for the product created vital tailwind for Evernote’s growth
- How the company resisted investor pressure and remained true to their convictions about the value of Evernote as a freemium product
- How Evernote lost sight of its original vision and how this almost doomed the company

- 为什么时机对 Evernote 的成功至关重要，以及联合创始人和前 CEO Phil Libin 对产品的愿景如何为 Evernote 的增长创造了重要的顺风
- 公司如何抵制投资者的压力，并坚持他们对 Evernote 作为免费增值产品的价值的信念
- Evernote 如何迷失了它的原始愿景，以及这是如何几乎让公司陷入绝境的

The idea for Evernote began with the personal quest of its founder, Stepan Pachikov. He aimed to solve a giant problem: overcoming the limitations of human memory.

印象笔记的灵感源于其创始人 Stepan Pachikov 的个人追求，他致力于解决一个重大问题：克服人类记忆的局限。

## 2008-2011: 构建一个难以实现的愿景

Stepan Pachikov wanted to remember everything.

Stepan Pachikov 想要记住所有事情。

Pachikov is one of Silicon Valley’s most visionary technologists. A pioneer of virtual reality, computerized handwriting analysis, and optical character recognition, Pachikov has spent much of his life working to solve some of computing’s most challenging problems.

Pachikov 是硅谷最富有远见的科技专家之一，他在虚拟现实、计算机手写分析和光学字符识别方面是先行者。他一生致力于解决计算机领域最棘手的问题。

Trained in economic mathematics, Pachikov earned his doctorate in fuzzy logic from the Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Moscow. As a scientist living and working under Communist rule in Soviet Russia, Pachikov was no stranger to the forgotten. He saw firsthand how generations of culture and collective memory were jeopardized by the gradual collapse of Soviet Russia. With few ways to preserve them, even key moments from his own past had been lost to the march of time.

Pachikov 接受了经济数学的训练，并在莫斯科的苏联科学院获得了模糊逻辑的博士学位。作为一名在苏联俄罗斯共产主义统治下生活和工作的科学家，他对被遗忘的事物并不陌生。他亲眼目睹了几代人的文化和集体记忆如何因苏联的逐渐崩溃而受到危害。由于几乎没有保存它们的方法，即使是他自己过去的关键时刻也已经被时间的流逝所吞噬。

"Even 30 years ago, I had already lost so much information. Names. Jokes. Phrases. Facts. I can study and re-learn what I have forgotten, but I cannot go back to my school years, my college years, and recollect what I knew. Teachers. Friends. Experiences. In the past 20 years, I have put 75,000 pictures into my photo database. But pictures from before that are lost." —— Stepan Pachikov, founder of Evernote

「即使是在 30 年前，我已经遗忘了许多信息。包括名字、笑话、短语和事实。我可以重新学习和研究那些我遗忘的东西，但我无法回到我的学生时代或大学时代，去回忆起我所知道的一切。那些老师、朋友和经历。在过去的 20 年里，我已经将 75000 张照片存入了我的照片数据库，但在此之前的老照片已经丢失了。」—— Stepan Pachikov, Evernote 创始人
