Sui Sui is a cat with a mischievous and playful demeanor, yet often endearing and charming, bringing a lot of healing to us.

He is already two years old, very healthy, but occasionally suffers from a slight skin condition.

He is quite a big guy, weighing a whopping 5.6 kg!

I made a small house for Sui Sui using discarded express delivery boxes, inside of which is his exclusive little bed and a winter-fleece bedding set. He loves it very much and now goes to sleep in it every night.

Although he looks a bit grumpy, he should still be very happy. 🙃
