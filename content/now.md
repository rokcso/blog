# What I'm doing right now

This is a snapshot of my current endeavors and focal points. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Life

Hangzhou has already entered autumn, and as you walk through the streets and alleys, you can constantly smell the fragrance of osmanthus flowers. Autumn is a very comfortable season, just as the saying goes, "the autumn sky is crisp and clear."

Unfortunately, due to the National Day holiday adjustment, I haven't had a normal weekend off for almost a month, so I haven't been able to find time to enjoy this season's motorcycle riding. This should be the last comfortable period for riding this year.

This weekend, I'm planning to give [Sui Sui](/p/suisui) his last bath of the year. I usually only bathe him twice a year, once in spring and once in autumn.

## Projects

My [pansou.vip](https://www.pansou.vip/?utm_source=rokcso.com/) project has started to generate income this month, but not from Google AdSense or paid inclusions, rather from product affiliate marketing.

The products distributed are mainly aimed at helping users earn side income. This once again confirms the saying, "It's better to sell shovels than to dig for gold."

I plan to start disclosing some of my side income data to a certain extent from next month.
