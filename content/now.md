# What I'm doing right now

This is a snapshot of my current endeavors and focal points. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Life

Hangzhou has officially entered the winter climate, with temperatures below 10Â°C. According to past experience, Hangzhou's winter is usually overcast and rainy on weekdays, while weekends are sunny, of course, this may just be describing my mood.

Last night, I made a small house for [Sui Sui](/p/suisui) using discarded express delivery boxes, inside of which is his exclusive little bed and a winter-fleece bedding set. He loves it very much and now goes to sleep in it every night.

## Projects

pansou.vip is undergoing a 3.0 upgrade and will become a brand new brand: [Pan Hunt](https://panhunt.com/?utm_source=rokcso.com). There are two reasons for this:

1. The technical architecture of pansouvip needs to be upgraded again, as the previous versions are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. This time, I worked with Cursor and Windsurf to complete many technical optimizations quickly.
2. I realized that the `.vip` domain name is SEO unfriendly, possibly due to too many black industries using this domain suffix.
