# What I'm doing right now

This is a snapshot of my current endeavors and focal points. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Life

The heat in Hangzhou is relentless these days, with temperatures soaring close to 40Â°C daily. Despite the sweltering conditions, I persist in commuting to work on my motorcycle every day. It's actually quite pleasant, the wind passing through me.

Sui Sui (My cat), has unfortunately been afflicted with ringworm once again, this time still on his face, a recurring issue that surfaces every two to three months. I've promptly administered medication to him and am hopeful for his swift recovery.

## Projects

All the going projects in [Projects](/projects) are projects that I am promoting and maintaining, and I will continue to invest in them.

At the same time, I am constantly coming up with new ideas, and maybe suddenly at some point, I will start.

### pansou.vip

In July, for reasons unknown, [pansou.vip](https://www.pansou.vip/) disappeared from Bing's search results, resulting in a significant drop in daily active users to approximately 400. Despite my repeated attempts to reach out to Bing's technical support, I've yet to receive a response. Consequently, it has become increasingly important for me to actively seek out recommendations from external sources and users.

Next, I will continue to complete the testing of all included websites on pansou.vip, This is a cumbersome matter.

Currently, pansou.vip generates negligible commercial revenue, with only a few cents in daily ad revenue (my stringent ad display policy results in minimal ad exposure for most users). I don't have any more ideas about this yet.

### Oh My Nav

[Oh My Nav](https://ohmynav.com/) is a website I recently started to share all practical software, websites, etc. It's a return to my roots in content creation, and I'm eager to re-engage with this endeavor, especially considering the anticipation of my subscriber base, which numbers over 4000.

However, I am still in the process of finalizing the website's content format. For now, my primary goal is to regularly update the "Daily Sharing" section, offering one or two concise and informative snippets each week.
