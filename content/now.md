# What I'm doing right now

This is a snapshot of my current endeavors and focal points. Inspired by [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Life

The temperature in Hangzhou has dropped a bit compared to half a month ago, and it's no longer as unbearable as it was.

Sui Sui (my cat) has also recovered from illness.

My girlfriend and I are planning to go to the seaside to watch the sunrise this weekend. Hangzhou is about 100km from the nearest seaside, so we have to set out early in the morning, of course, not by motorcycle!

## Projects

I spent two days launching a new website, [Skillix.cc](https://skillix.cc/). Currently, this website will provide navigation and recommendation services for the columns of [Xiaobaotong](https://xiaobot.net/) (a knowledge payment platform). If users pay through our website, I will receive a rebate, and I will also give a rebate to the users, so that they can purchase the columns at a lower cost.

Next, I plan to study RPA (Robotic Process Automation) because my current several navigation websites have too much data that needs manual maintenance, which is becoming an increasingly heavy burden for me.
