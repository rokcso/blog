<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>Hangzhou has already entered autumn, and as you walk through the streets and alleys, you can constantly smell the fragrance of osmanthus flowers. Autumn is a very comfortable season, just as the saying goes, &ldquo;the autumn sky is crisp and clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the National Day holiday adjustment, I haven&rsquo;t had a normal weekend off for almost a month, so I haven&rsquo;t been able to find time to enjoy this season&rsquo;s motorcycle riding. This should be the last comfortable period for riding this year.</p>
<p>This weekend, I&rsquo;m planning to give <a href="/p/suisui">Sui Sui</a> his last bath of the year. I usually only bathe him twice a year, once in spring and once in autumn.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://www.pansou.vip/?utm_source=rokcso.com/">pansou.vip</a> project has started to generate income this month, but not from Google AdSense or paid inclusions, rather from product affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>The products distributed are mainly aimed at helping users earn side income. This once again confirms the saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to sell shovels than to dig for gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I plan to start disclosing some of my side income data to a certain extent from next month.</p>
