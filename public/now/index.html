<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>The heat in Hangzhou is relentless these days, with temperatures soaring close to 40°C daily. Despite the sweltering conditions, I persist in commuting to work on my motorcycle every day. It&rsquo;s actually quite pleasant, the wind passing through me.</p>
<p>Sui Sui (My cat), has unfortunately been afflicted with ringworm once again, this time still on his face, a recurring issue that surfaces every two to three months. I&rsquo;ve promptly administered medication to him and am hopeful for his swift recovery.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>All the going projects in <a href="/projects">Projects</a> are projects that I am promoting and maintaining, and I will continue to invest in them.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am constantly coming up with new ideas, and maybe suddenly at some point, I will start.</p>
<h3 id="pansouvip">pansou.vip</h3>
<p>In July, for reasons unknown, <a href="https://www.pansou.vip/">pansou.vip</a> disappeared from Bing&rsquo;s search results, resulting in a significant drop in daily active users to approximately 400. Despite my repeated attempts to reach out to Bing&rsquo;s technical support, I&rsquo;ve yet to receive a response. Consequently, it has become increasingly important for me to actively seek out recommendations from external sources and users.</p>
<p>Next, I will continue to complete the testing of all included websites on pansou.vip, This is a cumbersome matter.</p>
<p>Currently, pansou.vip generates negligible commercial revenue, with only a few cents in daily ad revenue (my stringent ad display policy results in minimal ad exposure for most users). I don&rsquo;t have any more ideas about this yet.</p>
<h3 id="oh-my-nav">Oh My Nav</h3>
<p><a href="https://ohmynav.com/">Oh My Nav</a> is a website I recently started to share all practical software, websites, etc. It&rsquo;s a return to my roots in content creation, and I&rsquo;m eager to re-engage with this endeavor, especially considering the anticipation of my subscriber base, which numbers over 4000.</p>
<p>However, I am still in the process of finalizing the website&rsquo;s content format. For now, my primary goal is to regularly update the &ldquo;Daily Sharing&rdquo; section, offering one or two concise and informative snippets each week.</p>
